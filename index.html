          <p>On October 26th, South Korean girl group TWICE released their second full album, "Eyes wide open". While the album
            and its title track "I CAN'T STOP ME" received critical praise, many fans have been left disappointed by the
            song's financial performance.</p>
          <p>TWICE has been the dominant girl group of their generation: the pie chart at right shows the total album sales
            of the top 10 best-selling girl groups that are currently active, as of September 2020. TWICE's dominant sales
            figures have unrivalled for most of their time as a group.</p>
          <p>However, with the perceived underperformance of "Eyes wide open" - which, as a rare full album, many believed should
            have been a milestone - some fans have become worried that the group's success is on the decline.</p>

        <p class="small-font">(Note: TWICE also releases music in Japanese, with two full albums, three compilations and several singles. These
          are typically considered separate from their main Korean discography - the above chart only visualises Korean releases.)</p>

          <p>The bar chart on the left shows the pre-order sales for all of TWICE's releases, from oldest (top) to most recent
            (bottom).
          </p>
          <p>It should be noted that there are three different types of releases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>2 Full Albums:</b> Major releases with 13 songs each. Expected to sell the most.</li>
            <li>
              <b>7 Mini-Albums or EPs:</b> Regular releases with 6-8 songs each.</li>
            <li>
              <b>4 Repackages:</b> Additional releases of the previous album or EP. Expected to sell the least.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Also important is the fact that so far only one vendor, Ktown4u, has publicly released preorder numbers for "Eyes
            wide open".</p>

          <p>The above visualisation clearly shows that the sales of "Eyes wide open" have been dwarfed by its predecessor,
            "MORE & MORE".</p>
          <hr>
          <!-- section 1: more & more -->
          <h2>In the Shadow of MORE & MORE</h2>
          <p>TWICE's 9th Mini-Album "MORE & MORE", released on June 1st 2020, was a blowout financial success, with almost double
            the number of pre-orders as their first full album, Twicetagram, and more than double any other EP in their discography.</p>
          <p>Many fans' disappointment comes as a result of "Eyes wide open" being the first time a TWICE release has significantly
            underperformed compared to their previous one (not counting repackages, which are expected to do worse). However,
            rather than thinking of "Eyes wide open" as a failure, it may be more useful to think of "MORE & MORE" as an
            anomaly, for a variety of reasons.</p>
          <p>
            <b>1. Mina's Return:</b> One of TWICE's members, Mina, discontinued promotions with the group in early July 2019
            due to anxiety, and was absent for much of the group's world tour as well as their promotions for their 8th Mini-Album
            "Feel Special". "MORE & MORE" marked Mina's return to active group activities, which spurred many fans to support
            the album as a way of commemorating her return.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-3">
          <p>
            <b>2. Gaps Between Releases:</b> Another unique circumstance of "MORE & MORE" is that its release was delayed quite
            significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in by far the largest gap between Korean releases. This
            is visualised in the scatterplot on the far right - "MORE & MORE" sits far apart from the other releases both
            in sales and the days elapsed since its last release.</p>
          <p>The large gap between releases not only contributes to anticipation, but a significant portion of K-pop sales are
            often attributed to "bulk buying", a practice in which fans buy significant numbers of albums for the sole purpose
            of driving up sales numbers in support of their favourite group(s). The more time between releases, the more
            time fans involved in this practice would have to accumulate funds for bulk buying albums.</p>
          <p>The bar chart immediately right again shows TWICE's Korean releases in chronological order, but with their pre-order
            numbers normalised by the number of days since the previous release. In this view, we can see fairly consistent
            numbers across EPs and Albums (with "SIGNAL" being an early outlier), with Repackages performing highly as expected,
            as they are usually released in close proximity to the release they are a rerelease of.

          <h2>Global Markets and Expansion</h2>
          <p>Another aspect to consider is that TWICE's popularity may already have peaked in the markets they primarily market
            to. </p>
