          <p>On October 26th, South Korean girl group TWICE released their second full album, "Eyes wide open". While the album
            and its title track "I CAN'T STOP ME" received critical praise, many fans have been left disappointed by the
            song's financial performance.</p>
          <p>TWICE has been the dominant girl group of their generation: the pie chart at right shows the total album sales
            of the top 10 best-selling girl groups that are currently active, as of September 2020. TWICE's dominant sales
            figures have unrivalled for most of their time as a group.</p>
          <p>However, with the perceived underperformance of "Eyes wide open" - which, as a rare full album, many believed should
            have been a milestone - some fans have become worried that the group's success is on the decline.</p>

        <p class="small-font">(Note: TWICE also releases music in Japanese, with two full albums, three compilations and several singles. These
          are typically considered separate from their main Korean discography - the above chart only visualises Korean releases.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-3">
        <div class="description description-right">
          <p>The bar chart on the left shows the pre-order sales for all of TWICE's releases, from oldest (top) to most recent
            (bottom).
          </p>
          <p>It should be noted that there are three different types of releases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>2 Full Albums:</b> Major releases with 13 songs each. Expected to sell the most.</li>
            <li>
              <b>7 Mini-Albums or EPs:</b> Regular releases with 6-8 songs each.</li>
            <li>
              <b>4 Repackages:</b> Additional releases of the previous album or EP. Expected to sell the least.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The tooltip displayed when hovering over the bars shows the type of release.</p>
          <p>Also important is the fact that so far only one vendor, Ktown4u, has publicly released preorder numbers for "Eyes
            wide open".</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-1">
          <p>The above visualisation clearly shows that the sales of "Eyes wide open" have been dwarfed by its predecessor,
            "MORE & MORE".</p>
          <hr>
          <!-- section 1: more & more -->
          <img src="images/shadow.png" class="pure-img">
          <p>TWICE's 9th Mini-Album "MORE & MORE", released on June 1st 2020, was a blowout financial success, with almost double
            the number of pre-orders as their first full album, Twicetagram, and more than double any other EP in their discography.</p>
          <p>Many fans' disappointment comes as a result of "Eyes wide open" being the first time a TWICE release has significantly
            underperformed compared to their previous one (not counting repackages, which are expected to do worse). However,
            rather than thinking of "Eyes wide open" as a failure, it may be more useful to think of "MORE & MORE" as an
            overperforming anomaly, for a couple of reasons.</p>
          <p>
            <b>1. Mina's Return:</b> One of TWICE's members, Mina, discontinued promotions with the group in early July 2019
            due to anxiety, and was absent for much of the group's world tour as well as their promotions for their 8th Mini-Album
            "Feel Special". "MORE & MORE" marked Mina's return to active group activities, which spurred many fans to support
            the album as a way of commemorating her return.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <p>
            <b>2. Gaps Between Releases:</b> Another unique circumstance of "MORE & MORE" is that its release was delayed quite
            significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in by far the largest gap between Korean releases. This
            is visualised in the scatterplot on the right - "MORE & MORE" sits far apart from the other releases both in
            sales and the days elapsed since its last release.</p>
          <p>The large gap between releases not only contributes to anticipation, but a significant portion of K-pop sales are
            often attributed to "bulk buying", a practice in which fans buy significant numbers of albums for the sole purpose
            of driving up sales numbers in support of their favourite group(s). The more time between releases, the more
            time fans involved in this practice would have to accumulate funds for bulk buying albums.</p>
          <p>The bar chart on right shows TWICE's Korean releases in chronological order, but with their pre-order numbers normalised
            by the number of days since the previous release. In this view, we can see fairly consistent numbers across EPs
            and Albums (with "SIGNAL" being an early outlier), with Repackages performing highly as expected, as they are
            usually released in close proximity to the release they are a rerelease of.
          </p>
          <p>This visualisation shows that the performance of "Eyes wide open" is not too far off "MORE & MORE" from a time-normalised
            perspective, and is performing better under this metric than all other albums or EPs except for "MORE & MORE"
            and "SIGNAL".</p>
          <p class="small-font">(The bars in the bar chart can be clicked to highlight the corresponding points on the scatterplot.)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <img src="images/day.png" class="pure-img">
          <div id="vis4" class="vis-container"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <img src="images/mv_views.png" class="pure-img">

        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
          <p>Finally, pre-orders are not the only metric of a release's success: they were cited a lot as they were the only
            numbers available for a time, but after about a week of release, more data is available around "Eyes wide open".
          </p>
          <p>A better indicator of general public reception, at least to a release's title track, would be tracking music video
            views. Similar to bulk buying, fans do attempt to artificially inflate views by "streaming" (letting the video
            loop over and over), but YouTube has measures to freeze, delete or simply not count what they consider to be
            illegitimate views.</p>
          <p>The line chart on the left shows the total views of both the "MORE & MORE" and "I CAN'T STOP ME" (the title track
            to "Eyes wide open") music videos on YouTube over the first seven days of their release. It is immediately evident
            that they follow almost the exact same pattern, with "I CAN'T STOP ME" being slightly ahead at the end of the
            first week.</p>

          <img src="images/global.png" class="pure-img">
          <p>Another aspect to consider is that TWICE's popularity may already be close to peaking in the regions they primarily
            market towards. TWICE focuses the vast majority of their promotions in Korea and Japan (three out of nine of
            the members are Japanese), with some concerts in South East Asia.</p>
          <p>The group has enjoyed widespread popularity in Korea since their second title song, "CHEER UP" (released in April
            2016), went viral. TWICE's Japanese releases began in October 2017 and are ongoing to today, with their next
            single "BETTER" slated for 16 November 2020.</p>
          <p>The below map shows the tour locations of "Twicelights", the group's first world tour. It can clearly be seen that
            the majority of locations are in Asia (17 out of 29 in Japan alone), with four single concerts in various parts
            of North America.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-2-3">
          <p>A lot of fans' frustrations over "Eyes wide open" may have been influenced by the recordbreaking album "THE ALBUM"
            by the internationally-renowned girl group BLACKPINK, which smashed TWICE's "MORE & MORE" pre-order record to
            be the first Korean girl group in history to break 1 million pre-orders.</p>
          <p>Among other factors, such as "THE ALBUM" being the group's first full album despite debuting in 2016, a significant
            portion of these sales were attributed to the overseas market - no doubt influenced by BLACKPINK's collaboration
            with famous Western artists like Cardi B and Selena Gomez.</p>
          <p>With their limited promotions outside Korea and Japan, it might simply not be feasible for TWICE's sales to reach
            such heights without a stronger international following.</p>
          <p>But interestingly, international appeal is one area where the title track of "Eyes wide open" has excelled. "I
            CAN'T STOP ME" marks TWICE's first entry into
            <b>
              <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/twice">Billboard's Global 200</a>
            </b>, debuting at
            <b>#35</b> - a very strong showing for a group that has historically been missing from the chart entirely. </p>

        <div class="pure-u-2-3">
          <img src="images/conclusion.png" class="pure-img">
          <p>While "Eyes wide open" is certainly not an incredible success, much of its perceived failure is attributed to its
            placement as the follow-up to "MORE & MORE", which had an unusually high amount of anticipation building up to
            it. The album so far has performed up to par with TWICE's previous releases, as well as being a promising entry
            into the worldwide market that could spur further growth and success for the group in the future.
